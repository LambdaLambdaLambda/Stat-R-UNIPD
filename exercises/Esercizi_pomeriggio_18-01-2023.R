# The R dataset contains results from an experiment to compare yields 
# (as measured by dried weight of plants) obtained under a control and
# two different treatment conditions. It is a data frame of 30 cases on 2 variables.

# The response variable is given by the column weight.

#1. compute summary statistics using the function describe within psych package
#2. check normality with Shapiro test
#3. check homogeneity of variances according to group factor with the Levene test
#4. Plot the distribution using plot or histogram

# The kurtosis index indicates that the distribution of the response variable data 
# is not skewed.
# The sample mean is 5.07, and the median is 5.15. The fact that these values are close 
# to one another indicates a balanced distribution of the data, centered around the mean.

shapiro.test(weight)   # Shapiro - Wilk normality test

# The Wilk-Shapiro test has as null hypothesis the assertion that data is normally distributed
# since we get p-value = 0.8915 > 0.05 we accept the null hypothesis. i.e. weight values are
# normally distributed in the population of plants

car::leveneTest(weight ~ as.factor(group), data=PlantGrowth) #Leveneâ€™s test

# The Levene test has as null hypothesis the assertion that the variances are homogeneous
# across the two factors.
# Since we get p-value = 0.3412 > 0.05 we accept the null hypothesis. i.e. variance in the response variable does not depend on the
# values of the group factor.

# Q-Q Plot (quantile-quantile plot)

qqnorm(weight)
qqline(weight)

# The quantile-quantile plot shows that observations are concentrated between -2 and +2 standard
# deviations from the mean, revealing no outliers in the dataset. Moreover observations 
# fit nicely a straight line that correlates values of observations as a function of their 
# computed quantiles.
