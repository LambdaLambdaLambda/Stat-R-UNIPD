# Normality Tests
shapiro.test(milk)   # Shapiro - Wilk normality test
# a p-value = 0.04779  can be regarded as indicating a normal distribution
car::leveneTest(milk ~ as.factor(breed), data=cows) #Leveneâ€™s test
#skew below 0.48 is ok (if it is >= 0.5 then the sample could be not from a normal distribution)
#the null hypothesis of the Levene test is that variances are homogeneous
# we accept the null hypothesis because Pr(>F) = 0.5878 we have only 1 degree of freedom because the breeds are 2: "BrownSwiss" and "HolsteinFriesian"
